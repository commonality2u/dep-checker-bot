# Installation Guide

Welcome to the installation guide for **dep-checker-bot** ‚Äî a tool that helps you manage, audit, and keep your dependencies up-to-date.

## What is dep-checker-bot?

`dep-checker-bot` is a Python-based CLI that scans your project's dependencies, identifies outdated packages, flags vulnerabilities, and helps manage licenses. It‚Äôs a great way to keep your project secure and maintainable.
It automatically scans your `requirements.txt`, identifies outdated packages, checks for known vulnerabilities (CVEs), flags license issues, and even helps you generate badges and pull requests. It‚Äôs built for developers who want to ensure that their projects stay up-to-date, secure, and compliant, without having to manually check every dependency.


## Prerequisites

- üêç Python 3.10 or higher installed.
- üíª Basic knowledge of the command line.
- üì¶ `pip` (Python package manager).

## Why use a virtual environment?

Using a virtual environment is recommended because it isolates your project's dependencies from the global Python installation. This avoids conflicts with other projects and ensures consistency.

## Step 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/javiifu/dep-checker-bot.git
cd dep-checker-bot
```

## Step 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It‚Äôs a good idea to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows (note the double backslashes)
```

**Note:** On some systems you might need to use `python3` and `pip3` instead of `python` and `pip`.

## Step 3. Install Dependencies

Now install the dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the packages required to run the bot.

## Updating Dependencies

To update dependencies later on, you can run:

```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 4. Verify Installation

Run the following command to make sure everything is working:

```bash
python main.py --help
```

You should see the help menu with the available commands.

## Optional Configuration

If your project requires credentials (for example, GitHub API tokens), create a `.env` file in the root directory or set the necessary environment variables.

## Troubleshooting

- If you get a `ModuleNotFoundError`, make sure your virtual environment is activated and dependencies are installed.
- If you‚Äôre using a different Python version, adjust the commands accordingly.
- For any issues, please open an issue on GitHub.
